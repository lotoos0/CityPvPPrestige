# Post-MVP roadmap (3 items only)

Purpose: keep focus and avoid scope creep.

Current MVP scope note (Army system):
- PvP requires minimum units (gate only).
- Units are not consumed in PvP (no losses in MVP).
- Barracks is ownership-based, not city-grid placement.

1) Guilds (limited)
- Roles + basic chat
- Shared seasonal goals

2) Territory control (GBG-like)
- Async sector map
- Seasonal control rewards

3) Visual polish v2
- Building upgrades with clear level reads
- Simple idle animations (optional)
