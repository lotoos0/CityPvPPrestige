# Post-MVP roadmap (3 items only)

Purpose: keep focus and avoid scope creep.

1) Guilds (limited)
- Roles + basic chat
- Shared seasonal goals

2) Territory control (GBG-like)
- Async sector map
- Seasonal control rewards

3) Visual polish v2
- Building upgrades with clear level reads
- Simple idle animations (optional)
